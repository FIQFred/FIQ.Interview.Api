# Welcome to the FIQ Live Coding Session

In today's session, you will be asked to complete basic tasks on a .NET Core API project. Here are the requirements:

* Clone this project to your local environment.
* Establish a one-to-many relationship between the Project and WorkItem entities.
* Complete the GetProjectById endpoint by implementing the ProjectService.
* Seed some sample Project and WorkItem data and deploy it to a database.
* Call the GetProjectById endpoint.

For this exercise, you are free to use any resources, including the internet.

**One key requirement is that you need to provide explanations for each step as if the interviewee is a junior developer and you are mentoring them.**
